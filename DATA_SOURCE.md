If you're looking for the **most popular, stable, and longest-running** option, the clear winner is:

---

## 🥇 **Aladhan API**

### Why it stands out

✅ **Around since ~2014–2015** (one of the earliest widely adopted free prayer time APIs)
✅ **Very widely used** in mobile apps, Islamic websites, and open-source projects
✅ **No API key required** for standard usage
✅ **Backed by Muslim World League calculation support & multiple methods**
✅ **Well-documented and consistent JSON format**
✅ Offers:

* Daily prayer times
* Monthly calendar
* Hijri date
* Qibla direction
* Multiple calculation methods

It has become somewhat of a **de facto standard** for free prayer time APIs.

If you search GitHub, most open-source prayer apps reference Aladhan.

## 🥈 Other APIs (Less Established)

### **IslamicAPI**

* Requires API key
* More commercial positioning
* Newer than Aladhan
* Stable but less widely referenced in open source

### **UmmahAPI**

* Community-driven
* Smaller ecosystem
* Less long-term track record

### **Namaz Vakti API**

* Open and simple
* Not as globally recognized
* Smaller community usage

## 📌 Recommendation (For Production Use)

If you're building:

* A mobile app
* A Cloudflare Worker backend
* A portfolio Islamic widget
* Or even something commercial

👉 **Use Aladhan API.**

It has the longest track record, largest usage base, and most predictable uptime among free options.
