# Plugin Configuration
# 
# This file configures how your TRMNL plugin behaves:
# - How data is fetched (polling_url, webhook, static)
# - How often the display refreshes (refresh_frequency)
# - Which layouts are available
# - Plugin metadata

# Strategy: How to fetch data
# Options: "polling" (TRMNL fetches), "webhook" (you push), "static" (hardcoded)
strategy: "polling"

# Polling URL: Endpoint TRMNL calls to fetch data (required for polling strategy)
# TRMNL will make GET requests at refresh_frequency intervals
# Response should be JSON with your template variables
polling_url: "https://your-api.example.com/plugin/data"

# Refresh Frequency: How often to fetch data (in minutes)
# Range: 1-1440 minutes (1 minute to 24 hours)
# Lower = more frequent updates, higher = less battery drain
refresh_frequency: 15

# Available Layouts: Which template layouts this plugin supports
# All plugins should provide at least the 'full' layout
# Optional layouts: half_horizontal, half_vertical, quadrant
layouts:
  - full
  - half_horizontal
  - half_vertical
  - quadrant

# Plugin Metadata
name: "Example Plugin"
description: "A template plugin for TRMNL devices"
author: "Your Name"
version: "1.0.0"

# Tap Action: URL to open when user taps plugin (optional)
# Leave empty or remove if not needed
tap_action_url: ""

# Developer Notes:
# 
# 1. POLLING STRATEGY (used in this template)
#    - TRMNL sends GET requests to polling_url at refresh_frequency intervals
#    - Your backend should return JSON with template variables
#    - Example response:
#    {
#      "title": "Current Value",
#      "value": 42,
#      "has_data": true,
#      "status": "success"
#    }
#
# 2. WEBHOOK STRATEGY
#    - You push data to TRMNL when it changes
#    - Lower latency, more immediate updates
#    - Requires authentication setup in TRMNL dashboard
#
# 3. REFRESH FREQUENCY
#    - 1-5 minutes: Very responsive, higher battery usage
#    - 5-30 minutes: Balanced, good for most use cases
#    - 30+ minutes: Low battery impact, delayed updates
#
# 4. LAYOUT SELECTION
#    - full: Entire screen (default)
#    - half_horizontal: Side-by-side layout
#    - half_vertical: Stacked layout
#    - quadrant: Compact corner display
#
# 5. ERROR HANDLING
#    - Always include error states in your templates
#    - Check for missing/invalid data with {% if has_data %}
#    - Provide fallback content
