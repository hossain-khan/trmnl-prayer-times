# Prayer Times Plugin Configuration
#
# This file configures the Prayer Times plugin for TRMNL devices
# No backend needed - TRMNL calls Aladhan API directly

# Strategy: How to fetch data
# Using polling to fetch prayer times daily from Aladhan API
strategy: "polling"

# Aladhan API Endpoint: Fetch daily prayer times by address
# Format: /timingsByAddress/{date}?address={address}&method={method}
# Fetches today's prayer times (month/year default to current date)
# https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api#get-/timingsByAddress/
polling_url: "https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timingsByAddress/now?address={{ address }}&method={{ method }}"

# Refresh Frequency: How often to fetch prayer times (in minutes)

# Prayer times change once per day, so daily refresh is optimal
refresh_frequency: 1440

# Developer Notes:
#
# ALADHAN TIMINGS BY ADDRESS ENDPOINT:
# - Endpoint: /timingsByAddress/{date}
# - address: User's location (configured via custom field)
#   Examples: "London, UK", "New York", "Paris", "John's Street, Berlin"
# - method: Calculation method (configured via custom field)
#   Full list: https://aladhan.com/calculation-methods
#   Common methods:
#   0 = Jafari / Shia Ithna-Ashari
#   1 = University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi
#   2 = Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)
#   3 = Muslim World League (MWL) [RECOMMENDED - Default]
#   4 = Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah
#   5 = Egyptian General Authority of Survey
#   8 = Gulf Region
#   9 = Kuwait
#   10 = Qatar
#   11 = Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, Singapore

#
# WHY ADDRESS INSTEAD OF LAT/LON:
# - More user-friendly (no coordinate lookup needed)
# - Aladhan API automatically geocodes the address
# - Same response format as /timings endpoint
# - Supports natural language (street names, cities, countries)
#
# RESPONSE FORMAT:
